AFR vs VLM Evaluation Verification Module

This module provides comprehensive tools for evaluating and comparing
Automated Face Recognition (AFR) systems against Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
on various face recognition benchmarks.

Key Components:
- Feature extraction from multiple model architectures
- Face recognition dataset handling and preprocessing
- Evaluation metrics computation (TMR, FMR, ROC curves)
- Result summarization and analysis tools
- Configuration management for datasets and models
